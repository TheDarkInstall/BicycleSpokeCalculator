# BicycleSpokeCalculator
Detailed calculator for working out all measurements of a bicycle wheel.

The aim of this Repo is to reveal the workings of the system in detail, and hopefully get collaborative input / suggestions from others.

At this time, there is a todo list regarding getting this project into GitHub, so bear with me!

Working Google Drive version here;
