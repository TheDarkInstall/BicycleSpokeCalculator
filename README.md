# BicycleSpokeCalculator
Detailed calculator for working out all measurements of a bicycle wheel, including;

- Spoke lengths derived from hub and rim measurments
- Spoke tension
- Tension distribution / Balance
- Bracing angle of spokes

The aim of this Repo is to reveal the workings of the system in detail, and hopefully get collaborative input / suggestions from others.

At this time, there is a todo list regarding getting this project into GitHub, so bear with me!

Fully working Google Drive version here, which will be transferred to GitHub in due course for further development;
